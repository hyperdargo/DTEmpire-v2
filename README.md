- **Now Playing UI Overhaul:** Cleaner embed with bot icon, large banner image, progress updates, and footer status (volume, loop mode, queue position). Centralized to avoid duplicate messages.

  - `^announce setup <#channel>` — Set default announcement channel
  - `^announce help` — Show announcement help

Tip: Use `^music` or `^help music` for detailed guidance on music features, Smart Search, and DJ Mode.
