### 💰 Advanced Banking System

- **Fixed Deposits (FD):** Lock funds for 1-365 days at 3% daily interest rate (higher returns for long-term saving)

  - Commands: `^economy loan apply <amount>` | `^economy loan repay <amount>` | `^economy loan status`

### 📊 Income Tax & Fee System
- **Progressive Tax Rates by Income Source:**
  - Job Salary: 10% tax
  - Property Income: 8% tax
  - Gambling Winnings: 15% tax
  - Trading/Transfers: 5% tax
  - Lottery Winnings: 20% tax
- **Transaction Fees:** 2% fee on transfers over $50,000 (prevents wealth manipulation)
- **Auto-Tax Collection:** All taxes automatically collected into a server-wide pool

### 🎁 Tax Collection Giveaways (Community Feature!)
- **Automatic Giveaways:** When server taxes reach thresholds (500k → 1M → 1.5M → etc.), auto-giveaway triggered
- **How it Works:** 30-second reaction-based giveaway; winner takes entire tax pool!
- **No Winner?** Pool carries over to next threshold (growing prize pool!)
- **Admin Setup:** 
  - `^economy taxgiveaway setchannel #channel` - designate giveaway channel

  - `^economy taxgiveaway trigger` - manually start giveaway

### 💰 Economy Updates (v2.7.2 carry-over)
- **Daily Check-In** (`^economy daily` / `checkin` / `streak`): 24h cooldown with a 48h grace window to keep streaks, streak-based coin bonuses, XP, and reputation points.
- **Lottery System Overhaul:** 
  - 10-minute timer starts automatically when the first ticket is purchased
  - Timer persists through bot restarts (auto-resumes when the bot is back online; resumes countdown on first lottery command or ticket purchase)
  - **Rolling Jackpot:** If no one wins, the entire pot rolls over to the next round and keeps accumulating until someone wins!
  - Live countdown display shows time remaining until draw
  - Admin command `^economy forcelottery` to trigger draws instantly
  - Pick numbers 1-100, matching the random draw wins the accumulated jackpot
  - New `^economy lotteryresult` to view the last draw (winner or rollover) and current prize pool
  - Optional auto-ticket subscriptions: choose a number once, auto-apply every round (2k/round), immediate apply when enabled if available
- **Job Applications:** Jobs require player level now; list shows availability based on your level.
- **Steal Command Stability:** Fixed corrupt logic to restore victim DMs, fines, and cooldowns.

### 📅 Event Announcements
- New `^event <title> | <when> | <description> | [#channel]` command to post clean event embeds (requires Manage Server). Posts to the mentioned channel or the current one.

### 🛠️ Quality & Safety
